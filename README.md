> POSCO Group’s Enterprise Portal (EP) system is a business management system and corporate portal that acts as a gateway for accessing the internet and POSCO’s company intranet, where employees can access company-specific documents and applications. The EP Operations team is responsible for the construction and operation of the system’s search functionality and provides services to 40,000 employees of POSCO and their subsidiaries (about 20,000 POSCO employees and 20,000 employees of POSCO subsidiaries).

> The EP Operations team within POSCO’s IT Business Department found that replacing their legacy search solution with Elasticsearch had a positive impact on users’ satisfaction. The team is extremely pleased with the Elastic Stack’s various products and features, which have allowed them to manage and stabilize large amounts of data. The Operations team plans to continue to leverage even more aspects of the Elastic Stack in future projects, such as developing a system that detects server failure and a search system that delivers personalized results to users.
